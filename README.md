# Cloth_Store_Analysis_Excel

This Project is based on the data analysis of a cloth store based on which we generated a report to answer some of the crucial questions that will help in increasing the sales and overall growth of the store.

Tools Used:
Microsoft Excel

Firstly, we proceeded with the "Data Cleaning", that is, checking all the columns contain valid values only. Secondly, we did the "Data Processing" that will help us in data analysis. Now, we did the "Data Analysis" using 'Pivot Tables' & 'Charts' and based on that we shared insights with the store that will help them in growing their business.
